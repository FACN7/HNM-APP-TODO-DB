## Info for the reviewers

Smart people like you do not need any installation instructions :D Dont' forget npm i though

It is a team task management app.
Use these accounts to log in:

moses : hjkhjk536735kjklj367bshshdh
Natasha : sjkdhsajkdhgjk
bobby : fgashgfa

After log in things can look pretty ugly since we might have no time to merge CSS. 
There is a dashboard with tasks which each user can assign himself/herself to by pressing a button.
You can add a task to a common dashboard, too. 
After the task is taken, only the user who took the task can see it.
Relations are one to many (each task can be taken only by one user, a user can have many tasks).
That's it so far :D

Do not try to sign up or press a button next to the task of your user, that doesn't work.
Finished tasks is a dummy content, we'll try to create this function and the ones from the line above today.

Have fun, make some tasks for Bobby and sorry for the lame readme :)
